## Description

This application is designed to help administrators manage products and inventory in their online stores. The dashboard provides features for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting products, as well as managing the shopping cart.

## User Stories

We have one user that can behave like an admin or a regular buyer - which will be changed in the future (see Backlog):

- **Not Found** - As a user I can see a 404 page when I go to a page that doesnâ€™t exist so that I know it was my fault
- **Homepage** - As a user I'm able to access the homepage so that I see what the app is about
- **Product List** - As a user I can see all the products available so that I can choose from buy, edit, or remove
- **Create Product** - As a user I can create a product so that I can invite others to attend
- **Edit Product** - As a user I can edit a product so that I can update image, title, descirption, price, discount, anything.
- **Delete Product** - As a user I can delete a product.
- **Add Product to Cart** - As a user I can add a product to my cart & go through a mock payment flow.
